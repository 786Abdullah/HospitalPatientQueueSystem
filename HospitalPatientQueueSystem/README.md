Hospital Patient Queue System

A Data Structures & Algorithms semester project built in C++ to simulate a hospital patient queue using priority queues, hash tables, and sorting/searching algorithms.


Objective

To design and implement a hospital patient queue management system that:

 1. Automatically assigns unique patient IDs
 2. Prioritizes patients based on severity
 3. Allows doctors to manage and serve patients efficiently
 4. Stores and sorts patient checkup history


Features

 1. Priority queue (Max-Heap) for urgent patients
 2. Hash table with linear probing for quick lookups
 3. Patient check-in, checkup, and tracking
 4. Sorting by age, name, or checkup time
 5. Search by name or patient ID

| Component      | Technique        					      |                     Purpose             |
|----------------|------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------|
| Priority Queue | Max-Heap         					      | Serve critical patients first           |
| Hash Table     | Linear Probing   					      | Fast ID-based lookup                    |
| Sorting        | Quick, Select, Insertion Sort 			      | Flexible record sorting    		|
| Searching      | Linear, Binary   					      | Quick searches in patient history       |


Sample Menu Operations

1. Add New Patient
2. View/Serve Next Patient
3. Search by ID or Name
4. Sort Checked Patients
5. View Doctor Info

 Future Improvements

 1. Time-complexity optimization for sorting large datasets.
 2. GUI for better user interaction
 3. Handle multiple doctors & departments
